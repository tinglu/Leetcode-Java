 * TODO: review later - our total number of possible outcomes must be divisible by 7
 *
 * Worst-case O(\infty)O(âˆž) time (we might keep re-rolling forever) and O(1)O(1) space.
 *
 * Since 5 is already prime, any number that can be expressed as 5^n (where n is a positive integer)
 * will have a prime factorization that is all 5s. For example, here are the prime factorizations for 5^2, 5^3, 5^4...
 * 7 is also prime, so if any power of 5 were divisible by 7, 7 would be in its prime factorization.
 * But 7 can't be in its prime factorization because its prime factorization is all 5s (and it has only one prime
 * factorization).
 * So no power of 5 is divisible by 7. BAM MATHPROOF.
